# SPARC2019

The Technical Question folder contains the code for my simulations that I used for Technical Question 1A. It contains four files:
* simulation1.py - runs 1 simulation using the basic strategy.
* simulation1000.py - runs 1000 simulations of the basic simulation and prints out useful data.
* simulation2graph.py - runs 1 simulation using the improved strategy and displays a graph. (Requires matplotlib, which can be installed using `pip install matplotlib`
* simulation21000.py - runs 1000 simulations of the improved simulation and prints out useful data.
